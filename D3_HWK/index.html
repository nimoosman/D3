            <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Lack of Healthcare and Poverty</h2>
            <p>Our editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks 
              facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story 
              idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.</p>
  
            <p>The data set we used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. The current data set 
              incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."</p>
  
            <p>The scatter plot above shows that there appears to be a correlation between lack of healthcare and poverty.
              This could be for many reasons, however the obvious reason may be the most likely. 
              Individuals experiencing poverty may just not have the available funds to pay for health care.
              We do see that some states seem to show a stronger correlations between the two.
              Some states have better access to healthcare for people of lower socio-economic status, with 
              some states offering health insurance at no cost for their lowest income families.
